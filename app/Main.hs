      \ First, we read a form of Regular Expression, convert them\n\
      \ to an NFA and then check for various inputs. Please note\n\
      \ the syntax is limited to the ASCII alphabet & digits, parenthesis,\n\
      \ and symbols '.', '?', '+', '*', '|', '[', ']', '^', '\\d'\n\
      \ which represent the commonly known operations in Regular Expressions.\n\n\
      \ Please note, we do not have a fixed precedence rule for concatenation and alternation,\n\
      \ so please use paranthesis to group subexpressions together.\n\
      \ My algorithm is not limited to Regular Expressions. One only needs to find a way to translate\n\
      \ a problem to NFA input validation and define a parser for the appropriate NFA."
